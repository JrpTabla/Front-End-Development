	<h1>Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice</h1>

	<h4>PREAMBLE</h4>
	<p>
	The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction. The clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these <br>
	aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the <br>
	aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.<br><br>

	Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected <br>
	profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:
	</p>

	<h4>PRINCIPLES</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Public.</em> Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.</li>
		<li><em>Client and employer.</em> Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.</li>
